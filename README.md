# Optimization Problems Calculator

This web app provides a calculator for solving various optimization problems in mathematics.

## Main Goal
The main goal of this project is to bring an optimization problems calculator to one place, making it accessible and easy to use for anyone interested in solving optimization problems.

## Features
- **Simplex Method (Maximization)**: Implements the simplex algorithm for maximization problems.
- **Simplex Method (Minimization)**: Implements the simplex algorithm for minimization problems.
- **Dual Simplex Method**: Implements the dual simplex algorithm.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: Implements the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of real-valued functions.
- **Additional Methods**: More optimization techniques and algorithms to be added.
